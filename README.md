# WitsGo

WitsGo, the Campus Navigation and Transportation site, is designed to address critical mobility and accessibility challenges faced by students, faculty, and visitors on Wits Main Campus. Visitors, and students often encounter difficulties in efficiently navigating the extensive campus environment, optimizing travel routes, and accessing transportation services. The existing systems lack real-time updates, and accessibility features, resulting in inefficiencies, user frustration, and late arrivals.

The key problems WitsGo aims to solve are
- Limited Transportation: Currently there is a limit as to how people can travel on and around campus as the only options are by foot, private car, bus, and shuttle. 
- Complex Navigation: Navigating the sprawling and intricate layout of Wits Main Campus can be challenging, causing people to waste time, and become frustrated when trying to find specific locations or navigate between
  buildings. This problem is mostly seen in first year students and visitors.
- Lack of Real-Time Information: Users have limited access to real-time GPS tracking and transportation schedules, which hampers their ability to plan efficient routes and make timely travel decisions.
- Inefficient Route Optimization: There is a need for advanced tools to help users optimize their travel routes, ensuring they reach their destinations quickly and conveniently.
- Accessibility Challenges: Individuals with disabilities face additional barriers in navigating campus spaces, highlighting a need for better accessibility features.
- Inadequate Rental Management: Users require a more efficient system to locate, check the availability, and manage rentals to facilitate convenient transportation.

WitsGo will address these challenges by providing:
- Detailed Interactive Maps: Comprehensive maps with real-time updates to aid accurate navigation across Wits Main Campus.
- Real-Time GPS Tracking: Live tracking of user location and transportation services such as the Wits busses, to enhance route planning and management.
- Route Optimisation: Intelligent algorithms that suggest the fastest and most efficient routes based on current conditions and user preferences.
